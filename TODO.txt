1. Occupation field does not allow anything but "student" (from the dropdown).
    We need to allow entering of other occupations, or add some to the dropdown list,
    such as farmer, teacher, doctor, nurse, businessman, and businesswoman.

2. Age field defaults to "0". This field needs to be blank if we have no age.

3. Birthday does not save.

4. Numbers below 10 should be spelled (In comments sent back to students).

5. After saving a new student record, a default page shows instead of the page which was saved. 
    This is an intermittent problem that seldom happens. It might be related to the problem we just had,
    since the default page was the same in both cases.
